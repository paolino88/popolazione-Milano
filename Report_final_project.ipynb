    "Because I want to find some features that are significant to cluster the neighborhood, I use the dataset for the types of families in Milan's neighborhoods to see the percentage of every citizenship in every area. With this analysis, I understand what the weight of every nationality is and what are the similar neighborhood; in this case, the Italian families are on average the 80% of families in every zone for every category of age.  \n",
    "Done that, I create two new features, one for the number of people that live in the neighborhood and one for the density (people for squared kilometers) and I normalize these two features to obtain a value from 0.0 to 1.0.  \n",
    "Last but not least, I extracted the venues for every neighborhood (with a focus on not having duplicated values) and calculated the frequency of the venues' categories in each one.  \n",
    "Whit this venues' frequency, the density of population and the number of people, and the frequency of citizenship, I had created a dataframe to feed the clustering algorithm."

    "In this project, some analyzes have brought results that I would have expected even without having seen the data; i.e., the majority of the population in every neighborhood is Italian, and the most common venues' categories are Italian Resturant and Pizza place (in Italy there are a lot of this two in every city).  \n",
    "The thing that struck me most is that after all the first categories of popular venues (restaurants, hotels, and cafes), the next most common type is that of gyms. We could try to understand if there is a correlation of proximity between restaurants and gyms that could be useful for the opening of new restaurants."
